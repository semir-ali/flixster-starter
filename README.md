### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Paste the **shareable link** to your animated app walkthrough below (replace `ADD_LOOM_LINK_HERE`). GitHub markdown won't render an embedded Loom player, so a plain link is what graders will use. Make sure the link is public and playable before submitting. Ensure your walkthrough showcases the presence and/or functionality of all features you implemented above (check them off as you film!). Pay attention to any **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS** checkboxes listed above to ensure graders see the full functionality of your website. (🚫 Remove this paragraph after adding your walkthrough link.)

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes! I especially appreciated Lab 4 because it gave me experience working with states within React, which was especially important for this project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would add an authenication system so the onboarding for the website would be a lot more smoother. I also probably would've tried to find a more original color scheme than Netflix.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think my structure and product features were superb. I went above and beyond with getting information from API endpoints (i.e. cast information) which make the website feel more unique. I think I used a good amount of filler words, however, which made my presentation not the best and I want to try fixing that in the future. I also think I saw other peers have more original color schemes which is why I want to mimic that for future projects. 

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
Shoutout to Devarsh for helping me with states and Daniel for helping with Render deployment.
